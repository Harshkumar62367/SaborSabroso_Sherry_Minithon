# Sabor Sabroso - Blockchain-Powered Restaurant Feedback System üçΩÔ∏è

A modern, decentralized restaurant feedback system that leverages [Sherry](https://sherry.social/) technology to provide transparent and immutable customer reviews. Built with Next.js, Sherry and integrated with the Avalanche blockchain network.

## üåü Features

- **Decentralized Feedback System**: Store restaurant reviews and ratings on the blockchain
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Secure and transparent feedback storage using Solidity smart contracts
- **Real-time Updates**: Update your feedback and ratings anytime
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Algorithm to analyze feedback sentiment from your feedback
- **Modern UI/UX**: Beautiful, responsive interface thanks to Sherry Miniapps support.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Powered by Avalanche Fuji testnet

## Idea

Idea is to create MiniApps that can be attached to restaurant profiles on platforms like X or other social media, allowing customers to provide feedback and ratings for food and services. By using Avalanche Blockchain, we can securely save feedback messages and ratings directly on the blockchain, making them more trustworthy. 

Once fully developed, this app will serve as a one-stop platform for generating these MiniApps for restaurants and linking them to X. Restaurant owners will authenticate on the homepage, fill in some details, and create a unique Sherry link, which can be added to an X tweet and pinned. After visiting the restaurant, customers can visit the restaurant‚Äôs X profile to submit feedback. Using Sherry Actions‚Äô actionFlow (with dynamic actions), in future, we will reward feedback providers with custom tokens as appreciation, which can be redeemed for discounts on future visits. We also plan to implement a custom rendering of the average rating on the MiniApp frontend once this feature is available in the Sherry SDK. I will continue development of this app beyond the Minithon to enhance the app further with the database addition once the hackathon ends.
